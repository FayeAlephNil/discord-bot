# discord-bot

A discord bot created for the 296 discord server. The primary purpose of this bot is CTF--Capture the Flag--challenges

These challenges consist of "hacking" an internal DSL used by the bot for executing commands in order to capture some flag (string of text).

Class members can exchange flags for priviledges like being able to change their nickname on the server.
